# HealthMate-Personalized-Disease-Recommender

HealthMate is an AI-powered system designed to deliver smart, personalized healthcare suggestions by analyzing user-reported symptoms. Built with machine learning at its core, it empowers individuals to better understand their health risks and receive tailored wellness recommendations — bridging the gap between data and proactive care.

## Key Highlights
+ Smart Disease Prediction using Random Forest Classifier on multi-feature health data
+ Contextual Health Recommendations based on predicted conditions — including dietary tips, lifestyle changes, and when to consult a doctor
+ Performance Insight through precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
+ Scalable Architecture — easily extensible to mobile apps, wearable integration, or chatbot deployment

## Tool & Technologies
+ Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
+ Modeling: Supervised ML with Random Forest
+ Design & Planning: PowerPoint for architecture mapping
+ IDE: Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow Overview
+ Symptom Input – User provides symptoms through a form-like interface
+ Preprocessing & Feature Engineering – Cleaning and encoding health data
+ Model Inference – Predicts the most likely disease or health issue
+ Recommendation Engine – Returns personalized suggestions mapped from a knowledge base

## Why This Matters
HealthMate isn’t just about predictions. It’s about actionable insights — helping users take the right steps at the right time. It has the potential to evolve into a virtual health companion for everyday use.

## Future Roadmap
+ Deploy as an interactive web app (Streamlit/Flask)
+ Integrate with real-time health data (wearables, APIs)
+ Build a dynamic recommendation engine using NLP and patient feedback
